I am a Deep Learning Research Engineer volunteer at the [SEA Lab](https://lermanlab.github.io/), led by Prof. [Kristina Lerman](https://www.isi.edu/people/lerman/about) at [USC Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/), where I work with senior PhD candidate [Zihao He](https://zihaohe123.github.io/) on mitigating LLM hallucinations.

My research interests lie in Faithfulness/Factuality and Efficiency of Language Models. Methodologically, I study data-driven methods (improving curation of data and more robust metrics) and modeling methods (novel model architectures, training and evaluation paradigms). I am currently working on the effects of Knowledge Distillation on reducing hallucinations in LLMs.

I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California. Prior to this, I receieved a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from International University, Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City.
