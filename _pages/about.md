I am a Deep Learning Research Engineer volunteer at [USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI)](https://www.isi.edu/), where I work with senior PhD candidate [Zihao He](https://zihaohe123.github.io/) under the guidance of Prof. [Kristina Lerman](https://www.isi.edu/people/lerman/about). Before this, I was a Fellow Researcher at [DeepUSC Research Group](https://deep-usc.org/people#:~:text=Hieu%20Nguyen%20Tran%20Chi), working under the guidance of Dr. [Iordanis Fostiropoulos](https://iordanis.me/).

My research interests center on improving and better evaluating <b>Faithfulness and Factuality of Language Models</b>, focusing on data-driven and modeling methodologies. I am currently working on the effects of Knowledge Distillation on reducing hallucinations in LLMs.

I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California. Prior to this, I receieved a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from International University, Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City.
