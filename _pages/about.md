I am a Deep Learning Research Engineer volunteer at [USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI)](https://www.isi.edu/), where I work with senior PhD candidate [Zihao He](https://zihaohe123.github.io/) under the guidance of Prof. [Kristina Lerman](https://www.isi.edu/people/lerman/about).

My research interests center on improving the Faithfulness/Factuality and Efficiency of Language Models. Methodologically, I study modeling methods (novel training and evaluation paradigms, model architectures) and data-driven methods (improving curation of data and more robust metrics). I am currently working on the effects of Knowledge Distillation on reducing hallucinations in LLMs.

I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California. Prior to this, I receieved a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from International University, Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City.
