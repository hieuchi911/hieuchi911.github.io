    Mind maps created by [EduSummarise🧙‍♂️🔮 framework](https://github.com/harshkhub/EduSummarise), based on a video lecture on Lecture 3: File systems, from USC Computer Science Foundational data management class at USC.

<h5><b>A memorable proud day!</b></h5>

On April 6-7th, 2024, I got the opportunity to compete at TrojanHacks, a 24-hour hackathon competition held by [USC ACM](uscacm.org), where I worked in a team of 4 on a project focusing on the Education pillar.

We went from an exciting idea of a system that helps creating notes, mind maps, and personalized quizzes from video lectures for students to review lectures more effectively, to a very lame looking UI, and eventually to a GitHub repository showing only static images of LLM-generated mind maps on the presentation day. This happened because we couldn't fully commit to the project (2 of us got interview calls on the next day so of course they had to focus on what's more important, the other one tried to stay and work remotely, but I guess he was too upset to show up for the presentation, because we had nothing to present!). I almost gave up as well, but I still decided to present alone.

    This is me presenting EduSummarise🧙‍♂️🔮. "Can't believe I'm really doing this!!!"
</div>

I for sure am proud of myself for being so brave! The judges and the audience were also really nice and supportive, and I am really thankful to have presented to them.

<h5><b>A surprising result!</b></h5>

Our project came second! And we were awarded headphones 😎
